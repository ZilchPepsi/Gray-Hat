Program Ideas:

	Info Gathering:
		Search N subfolders (N is based on RNG/cost of program)
			Can be further subcategorized based on types of files it can detect (.exe, .key)
		Identify all programs running
		Check folder meta -> history, permissions, encryption type
		
	Objective Based:
		Encrypt folder/file - only defender?
			Uses a type of encryption
			Difficulty depends on total size
		Decrypt folder/file - only attacker? -- Can be used for victory condition
			Uses a .key to unlock compatible encryption
			Diff depends on size
		Make symbolic link - allows you to make random folder (is this useful?)
		Delete sym link - is this useful?
		
	Against Opponents:
		Defender only:
			Purge folder -- Can be used for victory condition
				Duration to purge depends on folder size
				Cannot purge trade secret/target file
		Attacker only:
			Send fake roaming .exe (as decoy intruders)
		Both:
			Change keyboard layout
			Freeze user folder viewport
			
		
Types of Files:
	.sym - link that is a 1-way bridge to some other folder
	.key - encryption key that unlocks a type of encryption
	.exe - program that can be used. Attacker also appears as a .exe
	.csv, .txt, .config, .doc, .mp3, .mp4, .vir, .etc - filler files just for fluff/noise
	
Notes on encryption/decryption mechanics:
	If player is inside a folder when encrypted, they will be booted to network view
	encryption/decryption should have 1 value number associated with it that determines the effective speed
		t_sec = folder_size / prog_value
		
Game logic should be hosted on defender computer

System Announcements:
	Folder you're in is being encrypted/purged
	If id_prog.exe is running, shows currently executing programs
	Message detailing program finished running
